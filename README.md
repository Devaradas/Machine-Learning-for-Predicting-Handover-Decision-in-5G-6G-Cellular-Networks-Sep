## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the code, simulation data, and research for my final-year Electronics and Communication Engineering graduation project (Istanbul Technical University). 

The project aims to optimize handover (HO) decisions in ultra-dense 5G and emerging 6G cellular networks. By leveraging Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, the goal is to predict the optimal time and target cell for handover, thereby minimizing the ping-pong effect, reducing latency, and ensuring seamless connectivity for high-mobility users.

**Timeline:** September 2025 – Present (Expected Completion: July 2026)

## 🎯 Objectives
* **Predictive Handover:** Transition from traditional threshold-based handover mechanisms (using RSRP/RSRQ) to intelligent, predictive models.
* **Network Optimization:** Reduce unnecessary handovers (ping-pong effect) and radio link failures (RLF) in dense urban deployments.
* **Dual Connectivity Support:** Analyze the impact of multi-connectivity and dynamic resource allocation on user equipment (UE) mobility.

## 🛠️ Methodology & Tech Stack
* **Simulation Environment:**  MATLAB
* **Machine Learning:** MATLAB ( ML Toolbox )
* **Key Features Extracted:** Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP), Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ), Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), UE velocity, and trajectory.
* **Algorithms Tested:** [ Decision Tree , Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Deep Neural Networks (DNN)] ( More models might be added for comparison )
